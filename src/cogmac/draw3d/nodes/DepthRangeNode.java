/**
 * Configures the depth range as stored in the z-buffer.  Normally, after
 * performing the <i>projection transform</i> and mapping all geometry to
 * normalized device coordinates, OpenGL performs <i>depth mapping</i> to map
 * the z-value of each fragment from (-1,1) to the range (0,1) before 
 * performing the depth test.  This class alters the depth range to simulate
 * a clipping plane separate from the near plane, without affecting the z-order
 * of the geometry.  For this class to work, the projection matrix MUST be modified
 * accordingly.  When this action is pushed, the nearplane of the projection 
 * transform should be set to clipDepth.  Rendering will then operate AS IF
 * the near-plane of the projection is at nearDepth, but fragments will be
 * clipped at clipDepth.
 * <p>
 * What we want to do is render some geometry with a cross-section effect,
 * where the cross-section is achieved by clipping fragements based on depth,
 * and then we want to render additional geometry into the same space without
 * the clipping.  The problem here is that the only way to perform depth-based
 * clipping is to use the near-plane of the projection transform , which means 
 * that the clipping plane MUST be mapped by the projection transform onto
 * the near-plane which MUST have depth = -1.  Therefore, the only way to 
 * render additional geometry in front of the clipping plane is to temporarily 
 * alter the depth buffer range, such that the nearplane gets mapped to 
 * something greater than 0 in the depth buffer.  The math here is kind a pain 
 * in the ass, as seen in the constructor, but it essentially computes the correct
 * z-buffer depth that correspond with an arbitrary clipping plane, so that 
 * the altered projection transform will be compatible with existing geometry.
